# Eternal2x

[![CI](https://github.com/Alitleis123/Eternal2x.com/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Alitleis123/Eternal2x.com/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Smooth 2x for hand-drawn animation, inside DaVinci Resolve Studio.

Anime is drawn on 2s or 3s: the artist draws twelve pictures a second and each
one is held for two or three frames to fill 24fps. That is why anime looks
stepped when you slow it down, and why running it straight through a frame
interpolator does nothing useful. Most neighbouring frames are identical, so
there is no motion to interpolate between them.

Eternal2x recovers the real drawings first, then rebuilds the shot.

```
source     A A B B C C C D D        9 frames, held on 2s
drawings   A   B   C     D          4 unique drawings
rebuilt    A a B b C c c D          in-betweens generated, C stays a held pose
```

The result has the same length and frame rate as the clip you started with, so
it drops straight back into your edit.

## What it does

- Finds duplicated frames and works out whether the clip is on 1s, 2s or 3s.
- Rebuilds the motion with optical flow, generating the in-between frames that
  were never drawn.
- Keeps deliberate held poses still, instead of smearing them into drift.
- Cuts stay hard. Blending across a scene change would show both shots at once,
  so it snaps instead.
- Upscales 2x using Resolve's Super Scale.

It works like Twixtor without the warping. Where forward and backward motion
disagree, which is where optical flow normally tears, it fades to a soft
dissolve rather than inventing a broken frame.

## Requirements

- **DaVinci Resolve Studio** 18 or newer. Super Scale and Optical Flow are
  Studio features, so the free edition cannot do the upscale. Eternal2x detects
  it and tells you rather than silently skipping it.
- Python 3.8+ on your PATH. The one-click installer sets up a private Python if
  you do not have one.

## Install

### One-click

1. Extract the download.
2. Run **`Eternal2xInstaller.exe`** on Windows, or the installer app on macOS.
3. It checks for Python, installs `numpy` and `opencv-python`, copies the
   plugin into Resolve's scripts folder and writes the config.
4. Restart Resolve and open **Workspace → Scripts → Eternal2x**.

### Manual

```
pip install numpy opencv-python
python Installer/install_eternal2x.py
```

Then restart Resolve.

The installer writes to Resolve's Comp scripts folder:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Comp\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Comp/`

The config records where the plugin folder is, so re-run the installer if you
move it.

## Using it

1. Select a clip on your timeline.
2. Open **Workspace → Scripts → Eternal2x**.
3. Click **Analyse**. It reads the clip and tells you what it found, for
   example `1438 frames, 719 unique drawings (719 held, 50%). Animated on 2s.`
   Nothing is changed, so this is safe to run on anything.
4. Click **Smooth Clip**.

The render runs in the background and the panel shows progress, so Resolve
stays usable while it works. When it finishes, the rebuilt clip is imported and
added to the end of your timeline.

### Settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Quality** | `Fast` for a quick look, `Better` for normal work, `Best` tracks fine detail like eyes and fingers at the cost of speed. |
| **Hold pattern** | Leave on `Auto detect`. Force `On 2s` or `On 3s` if a clip has unusual timing that trips the detector. |
| **Output** | `Image sequence` is lossless and always imports. `MP4` is a single compact file but lossy. `AVI` is a lossless single file that some Resolve builds will not import. |
| **Upscale 2x** | Applies Resolve's Super Scale to the imported clip. |
| **Interpolate** | Off means de-duplicate only, without generating in-betweens. |

Settings are remembered between sessions.

### What it will not do

If a clip has no duplicated frames, Eternal2x says so and stops. Live action
and animation already on 1s have nothing to recover, and smoothing them would
only invent motion that was never there.

## From the command line

Every button is a thin wrapper around one module, so you can script it:

```
python -m Stages.resolve_smooth --video shot.mov --analyse
python -m Stages.resolve_smooth --video shot.mov --quality best --format mp4
python -m Stages.resolve_smooth --video shot.mov --base-hold 3 --no-upscale
```

`--video` skips Resolve entirely and writes the result next to the source.
Add `--json` for a machine-readable summary.

## Updates

Eternal2x checks for updates at startup, or on demand with the
**Check for Updates** button. Updates are verified against a SHA-256 checksum
before being applied. Restart Resolve afterwards.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Plugin folder not configured" | Re-run `python Installer/install_eternal2x.py`. |
| "Could not reach Resolve" | Open the panel from Workspace → Scripts, not from a terminal. |
| "No clip selected" | Click a clip on the timeline, then press **Use Selected Clip**. |
| Analyse says nothing to do | The clip has no duplicated frames. It is live action, or already on 1s. |
| Progress seems stuck | Press **Refresh Progress**. If a run was interrupted, press **Reset**. |
| Resolve would not import the render | The render still finished. The panel prints where it is, so drag it into your media pool. Switching Output to `Image sequence` avoids this. |
| Upscale skipped | Super Scale needs Resolve Studio. |
| Something else | Run `python -m Stages.resolve_probe` from Workspace → Scripts. It reports exactly which API methods your Resolve build offers. |

## Development

```
./test.sh
```

235+ tests, no Resolve required. The suite fakes the Resolve scripting API and
runs the Lua panel under an embedded Lua runtime, so buttons, commands and the
full render pipeline are all covered headlessly. See `tests/README.md`.

Tests run on Linux, macOS and Windows against Python 3.9 and 3.12.

To cut a release, bump `VERSION` and push a matching tag:

```
git tag v0.3.1 && git push origin v0.3.1
```

The release workflow builds the archives, publishes them, checks the published
downloads really resolve, and refreshes `update/latest.json`. The tag is derived
from `VERSION` in one place, so the archives, the tag and the update feed cannot
drift apart.

To build locally without publishing:

```
python Installer/build_release.py            # build the folders and zips
python Installer/build_release.py --publish  # build, tag, upload, verify
python Installer/build_release.py --verify   # check the live feed is sound
```

Archives are byte reproducible, so rebuilding a tag on any machine gives the
same checksums as the published ones.

"""Generate in-between frames from a pair of drawings using optical flow.

The approach is the classic one: estimate motion in both directions, pull each
drawing towards the in-between time, and blend. What matters for hand-drawn
animation is the failure mode. Where the two flows disagree -- occlusions, a
limb appearing from behind a body, a cut -- warping produces the tearing and
melting that optical-flow retimers are notorious for. Those regions are
detected and softened into a plain cross dissolve instead, which reads as
motion blur rather than as a glitch.

Two drawings that are identical produce zero flow and therefore an identical
in-between, so deliberate held frames stay perfectly still.
